# Kickstarter
A more efficient version of https://www.kickstarter.com/,fixed flaws that included protecting the investors from frauds.
Funds can only be used when the majority of investors are in favor of the spent request hence reducing the possibility of fraudulent behavior from the investee.
Used solidity to write the smart contract which is deployed on the rinkeby test network.
Used Semantic UI for application UI
